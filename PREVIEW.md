For my final draft, I ended up including a lot more than I originally was going to. I started off the intro with the ocean and questioning "What do you think love is?", and Ryan is the first to respond. Again, he is talking about his girlfriend, Kayla, and how she serenades him. Then I go into Sebastian, Tim, Danny, Sam, and myself. What I am trying to convey is the way that love is portrayed in different viewpoints. Ryan had someone to actually talk about. Tim, Danny, Sebastian, Sam, and I are not referencing anyone in particular. That was the beauty of my project. We also all had something different to say.

In the background, you hear the ocean for a lot of it. I love the beach and nature and I wanted to incorporate that. The crashing of the waves lined up really nicely with the speaking of my friends, so I really liked the unintentional, concurrent sounds. In between a silence, you can hear a treadmill running too. Later, you hear laughing and tennis being played in the background. I recently got into racquetball, so I thought that would be fun to include. Lastly, I speak, and in the background you can hear me sing "Stay With Me" by Sam Smith. I normally don't sing for other people, so this was a step out of my comfort zone. I am not really sure whether I really want to keep it, but I think it adds a nice personal touch,

I played the final recording for the people who helped me make it, and they all really liked it.
