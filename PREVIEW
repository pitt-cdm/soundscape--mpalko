For the files, I have added two different folders. One folder has individual sounds which has my two friends talking. 
Ryan is talking about his girlfriend, Kayla, and the other two individuals speaking are Tim and Sebastian.
They all speak about love in different ways, and I wanted to include all of their perspectives. Then I combined Ryan and Sebastian's voices. This is seen in the What is Love Part 1. As it is updated, I will include different parts. 

For the future, I will be including more voices and more sounds. I should be adding the sound of a treadmill, water boiling, and more later. The goal of these items is to show how love can manifest itself in the things I love to do. It is not just limited to one person or group of people. Love is a form of attention. That is what my soundscape is trying to portray. I will record myself at some point speaking about what I think it is as well.
