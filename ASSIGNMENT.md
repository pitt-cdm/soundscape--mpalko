# Project 1: Soundscape Narrative

Your task in this unit is to **arrange layers of sound to convey a sense of place and story.** In assigning this, I have two main goals for you: (1) to learn how to capture sound and edit it using digital tools, and (2) to explore the affordances of sound as a medium, with particular attention to its ability to communicate *immersive environment* and *narrative pacing and change*. The genre of the narrative you convey is open: it could be documentary, fictional, even science-fictional. (The title you choose will help steer listeners' expectations, and thus their perceptions.)

As you start planning your composition, consider: in what place (physical, virtual, or imaginary) could you anchor your soundscape? What kinds of stories happen there, and which of them could you reasonably tell within a few minutes? How can you represent that environment sonically? What sounds are relatively stable, or sustained, and what is incidental? What structures or sequences could help a listening audience follow?

You don't need answers to all of these questions before getting started, but asking them early and returning to them often could help you get a sense of the soundscape you want to make.

## Generative constraints
We can revisit these after we get into the midst of composing, but to get you started:

* At least 75% of the sounds should be original recordings by you or your classmates.
* At least one of the sounds should be an original recording by you.
* At least once, you should have four layers of sound overlapping.
* The final product should play for no less than three minutes, and no more than four.

<!--
Possible additional constraints
* Use only sound effects (no speech)
* Use at least one sound longer than 25 seconds and at least one sound shorter than 5 seconds
-->


## Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to your own copy of this assignment repository. I recommend that you **save often, using meaningful commit messages**; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).


| date | what's due | expected files |
|----|----|----|
| Tues Jan 22 | Soundscape Proposal | Thinking in writing about what you'd like to do for this assignment. Turn in: <ul><li>A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) **proposal file**, suggesting in prose the place and premise of your soundscape narrative.</li><li>In a separate file called ASSETS.md, include a **prospective assets chart** (see *Writer/Designer* p. 149).</li></ul> |
| Thurs Jan 24 | Soundscape Preview | An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in: <ul><li> A layered **Audacity project file (.aup)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far (need not be a complete soundscape or narrative yet).</li><li> A static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress (for comparison later to subsequent drafts).</li><li>The **_data folder** associated with your Audacity file, which should contain at least two recorded sounds.</li><li> A plain text (.txt) or markdown (.md) file, explaining in at least 300 words **what you're showing us** in this preview. Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!</li><li> An updated **ASSETS.md**, now with the files you actually recorded or otherwise obtained. <ul><li>Add source documentation for any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use; see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165).</li></ul></li></ul> |
| Tues Jan 29 | Soundscape Draft | A solid attempt at a complete soundscape narrative, ideally at the target length. Turn in:<ul><li>A layered **Audacity project file (.aup)**, showing the arrangement of your sounds so far</li><li>The **_data folder** associated with your Audacity file, containing your audio snippets.</li><li>At least one more static **[screenshot](https://www.take-a-screenshot.org/) (.png or .jpg)** of your Audacity file in progress. <ul><li>Think about what moments are worThurs remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?</li></ul></li><li>An **updated README.md file**, introducing the soundscape narrative to a new audience.</li><li>An **updated ASSETS.md file**, including documentation of any outside sources – and your permission to use them (e.g. licenses, fair use); see *Writer/Designer* p. 160-165.</li></ul>  |
| Sun Feb 5 | Soundscape Final Draft | Include the same five components as in the earlier draft, but updated. |
| Tues Feb 7 | Soundscape Reflection | Give a sense of the work you put into your soundscape and whether it accomplishes what you wanted it to. Turn in: <ul><li>at least 500 words describing the work you did</li><li>at least two screenshots showing your work in progress</li><li>at least one photograph of a notecard with feedback that you responded to in revising (and please say how)</li><li>your own assessment of how you met the baseline criteria for the class, as well as aspirational criteria as appropriate </li></ul> **Post your reflections to the course site's [Issue queue](https://github.com/pitt-cdm/miller2019spring/issues/2)**, to make it easier to embed images. (If you want to then copy the source code into a file in your repo called reflections.md, I won't stop you!) |


## Setup

1. Now that you've copied this assignment repository, you'll want a local copy on your computer. [Follow the cloning instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) for your operating system, making sure to put the cloned folder in a place on your computer where you can easily find it.
2. Because sound files can take up a lot of space, we'll be using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/), an add-on service that lets you designate certain file extensions as worth tracking and storing off-site, rather than directly in your repository.
   * I've already set up this folder to track .wav, .mp3, and .ogg files this way, but you'll need to install the LFS service to make it work.
   * Simply go to that URL, download, enter the command in step 1, and you're on your way: I've done step 2 for this repo, and there is no step 3!
